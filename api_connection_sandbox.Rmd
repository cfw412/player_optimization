When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r message=FALSE, message=FALSE}

if (!require(tidyverse)){
  install.packages('tidyverse')
}
library(tidyverse)

if (!require(tidyr)){
  install.packages('tidyr')
}
library(tidyr)

if (!require(httr)){
  install.packages('httr')
}
library(httr)

if (!require(jsonlite)){
  install.packages('jsonlite')
